# Git Commit Changes

I'm using the git-commit skill to create a commit for your changes.

Before committing, I'll:

1. Review git status and diffs to understand what's changing
2. Draft a commit message that explains WHY (not just what)
3. Follow your repository's commit message conventions
4. Stage the appropriate files
5. Create the commit with proper attribution
6. Verify the commit succeeded

What changes would you like to commit?
