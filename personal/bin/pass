# Pass - Look Up Passphrase Words
#
# DESCRIPTION:
#   Looks up words from a wordlist for creating passphrases. Useful for
#   generating memorable but secure passwords using diceware-style word lists.
#
# USAGE:
#   pass <pattern>
#
# ARGUMENTS:
#   pattern  - Search pattern or line number to look up
#
# EXAMPLES:
#   pass 12345        # Look up word at position 12345
#   pass "^apple"     # Find words starting with "apple"
#
# SECURITY NOTES:
#   - Command appears in shell history unless prefixed with space
#   - Run with leading space: " pass 12345" to avoid history logging
#   - Script reminds you to use leading space for security
#
# DEPENDENCIES:
#   - Wordlist file at /usr/local/etc/wordlist.txt
#   - EFF wordlist recommended: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases
#
# NOTES:
#   Alternative commented-out option uses built-in /usr/share/dict/words.
#   For diceware-style passphrases, use EFF's wordlist.
