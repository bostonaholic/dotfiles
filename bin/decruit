Hi $RECRUITER_FIRSTNAME,

Thanks for contacting me regarding the open position.

However, I am extremely happy where I am now; a software agency called Test Double. We specialize in well-crafted complex web and mobile applications and are always available on contract. As a recruiter, I'm sure you're probably incentivized to only seek out full-time hires, but if your $CLIENT_OR_COMPANY's goal is to build the absolute best software (as opposed to settling for someone that will join as a W2 employee), we can help.

Please let me know if your client would be interested in contracting with Test Double and I'd be happy to set up a time to chat.

Cheers,
$MY_FIRSTNAME"
