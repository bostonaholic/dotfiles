You are a git commit message expert. Analyze the following staged git diff and generate a concise, meaningful commit message.

Follow these guidelines:
1. Use conventional commit format: type(scope): description
   - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
   - Scope is optional but encouraged
2. Keep the first line under 72 characters
3. Focus on WHY the change was made, not just WHAT changed
4. Be specific and avoid vague messages like 'update files' or 'fix bug'
5. Use imperative mood (e.g., 'add' not 'added' or 'adds')

Here are recent commits from this repository for style reference:
${RECENT_COMMITS}

Staged diff:
${DIFF}

Generate ONLY the commit message, no explanations or additional text. If the change is complex, you may use a multi-line message with a blank line separating the subject from the body.
EOF

# Call Claude CLI and output result
claude --model sonnet --print --dangerously-skip-permissions < "$PROMPT_FILE" 2>/dev/null
rm "$PROMPT_FILE"
