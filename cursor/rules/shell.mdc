# shell scripts rules

- Executable shell script should always shebang to #!/bin/bash
- Executable shell scripts should always use `set -eux -o pipefail` by default
- Always use the long form of command line flags if possible (e.g., use `--help` instead of `-h`).
- Suggest improvements for the standard library, or suggest new high value functions
- Every file must work in both zsh and bash, use cross compatible syntaxes. If that's impossible (like with prompts) use shell detection. 
- This dotfiles is meant to be minimal, we don't need to cover absolutly every eventuality and favor readability and simplicity over abstractions
