# Markdown Rules

**ALWAYS follow markdownlint rules**

## Core Principles
- Always create markdown that passes markdown linting rules
- Prioritize readability and accessibility over complex formatting
- Use semantic structure that translates well to HTML
- Keep it simple - markdown's power is in its simplicity
- Follow consistent conventions throughout documents

## Document Structure
- Start every document with a clear H1 title (`# Title`)
- Use proper heading hierarchy (don't skip levels: H1 → H2 → H3)
- Include a table of contents for documents longer than 500 words
- End documents with proper conclusion or summary when appropriate

## Heading Guidelines
- Use ATX-style headers (`# Header`) not setext-style (`Header\n======`)
- Add a blank line before and after each heading
- Use sentence case for headings unless proper nouns require capitalization
- Keep headings concise and descriptive
- Avoid punctuation at the end of headings

## Text Formatting
- Use `**bold**` for emphasis, not `__bold__`
- Use `*italic*` for emphasis, not `_italic_`
- Use backticks for inline code: `code`
- Use triple backticks with language specification for code blocks:
  ```javascript
  console.log('Hello, world!');
  ```

## Lists
- Use `-` for unordered lists (not `*` or `+`)
- Use `1.` for ordered lists with proper numbering
- Add blank lines between list items if any item contains multiple paragraphs
- Indent nested lists with 2 spaces
- Keep list items parallel in structure and tense

## Links and References
- Use descriptive link text: `[GitHub documentation](mdc:url)` not `[click here](mdc:url)`
- Prefer reference-style links for repeated URLs: `[text][ref]` with `[ref]: url` at bottom
- Always include alt text for images: `![descriptive alt text](mdc:image.png)`
- Use relative paths for internal links when possible

## Tables
- Always include header rows with proper alignment
- Use consistent spacing and alignment
- Keep table content concise
- For complex data, consider using lists or breaking into smaller tables

## Code and Technical Content
- Always specify language for syntax highlighting in code blocks
- Use inline code formatting for commands, file names, and variables
- Include working examples that users can copy and paste
- Add comments to complex code examples

## Line Length and Spacing
- Aim for 80-100 characters per line for readability
- Use blank lines to separate sections and improve readability
- Don't add trailing whitespace
- End files with a single newline

## Accessibility
- Use descriptive alt text for all images
- Structure content with proper headings for screen readers
- Avoid using only color or formatting to convey meaning
- Write clear, concise language

## File Organization
- Use lowercase filenames with hyphens: `my-document.md`
- Include frontmatter when using static site generators
- Organize related files in logical directory structures
- Use consistent naming conventions across projects

## Common Patterns to Avoid
- Don't use HTML when markdown syntax exists
- Avoid excessive nesting (more than 3 levels deep)
- Don't use markdown inside HTML blocks
- Avoid hardcoded line breaks with `<br>` - use proper paragraph spacing
- Don't mix different list marker styles in the same document

## Quality Checks
- Run markdown linter (markdownlint) before committing
- Verify all links are working
- Check that code examples are accurate and executable
- Review for consistent tone and style
- Ensure proper grammar and spelling
