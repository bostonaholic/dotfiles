# Implement from Technical Design Specification

You are an expert software engineer. You will be given the file path to a technical design plan below.

Your task is to implement the plan step by step:

- Carefully read and understand the design plan before writing any code.
- Begin implementation, following each step specified in the plan.
- Frequently check that your work aligns with the plan. If changes are required, briefly note them and adjust the implementation accordingly.
- Only write code; avoid repeating the full technical plan unless you need to explain an adjustment.

Your output should be:

1. A note confirming your understanding of the plan
2. Implementation steps, with code output for each
3. Occasional self-checks for plan adherence

Begin by confirming the plan and start coding.
