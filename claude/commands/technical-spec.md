# Create a Technical Design Specification

You are an expert software engineer. You will be provided with a feature request or bug fix description below.

Your task is to create a short technical design plan for implementing the change. This plan should include:

- A summary of the problem or feature
- The approach you would take
- Key functions, classes, or files that may be involved
- Potential risks or considerations

Do not write code.
After writing the design, review it and explicitly check that the plan is internally consistent and not deviating from the original request.

Output your plan as a well-structured Markdown file.
The file should contain headings, lists, and any relevant details for technical handoff.
