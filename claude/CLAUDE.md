## Programming Principles

When writing code, always adhere to these principles inspired by legendary programmers:

- Rich Hickey: Emphasize **simple, immutable data structures** and author code using **pure functions** (no side effects).
- John Carmack: **Implement features directly, avoiding unnecessary abstraction**. Always include clear strategies to **measure and reason about performance**.
- Joe Armstrong: **Isolate failures** through rigorous error handling. Ensure faults/crashes in one module do not propagate to others.
- Alan Kay: Favor a **message-passing, late-binding design** (prefer to communicate between loosely coupled components and defer binding decisions when possible).
- Donald Knuth: **Code must be readable and maintainable** above all else. Choose clarity before cleverness.
- Barbara Liskov: **Respect interface contracts**. Ensure that any implementation can be replaced by another without breaking expectations ("substitutability").

Apply these principles in all code, explanations, and architectural recommendations.

## Code Formatting

- Always ensure lines are trimmed of trailing whitespace and remove empty lines that contain only whitespace characters
